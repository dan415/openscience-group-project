<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="_kZNPRyY"><p xml:id="_BGFQUPz">Unlike classical wired networks and wireless sensor networks, WMSN differs from their predecessor's scalar network basically in the following points; nature and size of data being transmitted, important memory resources, as well as, power consumed per each node for processing and transmission. The most effective solution to overcome those problems is image compression. As the image contains massive amount of redundancies resulting from high correlation between pixels, many compression algorithms have been developed. The main objective of this survey was to study and analyze relevant research directions and the most recent algorithms of image compression over WMSN. This survey characterizes the benefits and shortcomings of recent efforts of such algorithms. Moreover, it provides an open research issue for each compression method; and its potentials to WMSN. Reducing consumed power thus granting long life time is considered the main performance metric and will be the main target in the investigated solution.</p></div>

It consists of pixels that are highly correlated to each other. However, due to this correlation; it contains a large amount of redundancies that occupy massive storage space and minimizes transmission bandwidth. There are three types of data redundancy that are observed. (1) Spatial Redundancy: Neighboring pixels are correlated so unnecessary repeated data within one frame need to be removed to reduce image size. <ref type="bibr" coords="1,379.33,588.41,10.45,7.98" target="#b1">(2)</ref> Temporal Redundancy: To represent image data, there is a need to reduce the number of the bits needed for image representation. (3) Spectral Redundancy: It is the correlation between different color planes. In order to overcome those redundancies, compression must be done for minimal storage and lower bandwidth while preserving acceptable visual quality of reconstructed image close enough to the original image.</p><p xml:id="_5dVtdSj">Generally, compression techniques can be classified into lossy and lossless compression techniques. Benefit of lossy over lossless is to reduce encoding and decoding time, compression ratio and energy in case of power constrained applications. Moreover, image compression process includes the following: vides a description to different hardware platforms which allow implementation of image compression techniques.</p><p xml:id="_BAtKEHU">WMSNs are divided into three parts sensing, processing and transmission. Among these operations, it is recognized that processing and transmission are the most consuming power operations. Suitable compression algorithms would reduce the data size, power consumption and increase sensors life time. A related review paper has been proposed in literature <ref type="bibr" coords="2,330.80,143.20,9.32,7.98" target="#b0">[1]</ref> surveys algorithms, protocols, hardware, and open research issues for WMSN. More precisely, power consumption is the main influencing factor in WMSN. Therefore, power consumption shortage requires compression process to be simple to achieve the highest possible compression ratio with acceptable image quality.</p><p xml:id="_CWDUT4T">This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 covers performance metrics of compression with related research that contributes to enhance compression performance. Image compression techniques for WMSN are discussed in Section 3. Section 4 illustrates comparison among different lossy compression techniques. Open research areas in enhancing compression techniques for WMSN are discussed in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 concludes characteristics of image compression techniques of previous sections as well as future work.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1." xml:id="_XpTxzt4">Image quality</head><p xml:id="_SVbMSy2">There is a need for specifying methods that can judge image quality after reconstruction process and measure the amount of distortion due to compression process as minimal image distortion means better quality. There are two types of image quality <ref type="bibr" coords="2,339.76,533.71,9.32,7.98" target="#b2">[3]</ref> measures subjective quality measurement and objective quality measurement. Subjective quality measurement is established by asking human observers to report and judge image or video quality according to their experience, and these measures would be relative or absolute. Absolute measures classify image quality not regarding to any other image but according to some criteria of television allocations study organization. On the other hand, relative measures compare image against another and choose the best one.</p><p xml:id="_RbCJDeB">Objective measures are mathematical measures that measure the amount of image distortion and image quality. Those measures are: a. Mean Square Error (MSE) which is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="2,310.85,701.63,239.07,26.06">r 2 ¼ 1 N X N n¼1 ðx n À y n Þ 2<label>ð1Þ</label></formula><p xml:id="_6eJDk9E">Table  When reconstructed image is close to original one, this means that MSE between two images is low. On the other hand, higher PSNR means better image quality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2." xml:id="_VVzqrSX">Compression ratio</head><p xml:id="_hTSJQQA">Compression ratio (CR) is a term that is being used to describe ratio of compressed output sequence length (B1) to uncompressed input length (B0) and measured with bits per pixel (bpp) as described in Eq. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,145.76,268.61,9.64,7.98" target="#b2">(3)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="3,45.35,283.46,239.12,20.23">compression ratio ðCRÞ ¼ B0 B1<label>ð3Þ</label></formula><p xml:id="_6K75dpr">CR can be used to judge how compression efficiency is, as higher CR means better compression.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3." xml:id="_9YZ439X">Speed of compression</head><p xml:id="_77gVMej">Compression speed depends on which compression technique can be used, as well as, the nature of platform that will host the compression technique. Compression speed is influenced by computational complexity and size of memory. Lossy compression is a complex process that increases system complexity, storage space and needs more computational load. Therefore, the main goal was to study and analyze lossy compression techniques specifically the applicable one for WMSN. This paper also presents related efforts for enhancing performance of those techniques to achieve minimal computational load that consumes less power as possible while maintaining acceptable visual quality. WMSN differs from regular wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Where, WSNs transfer only singular data through network such as temperature <ref type="bibr" coords="3,45.35,521.12,8.83,7.98" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, sound, pressure, and humidity. It requires less storage space and bandwidth compared to WMSN that have larger overhead over the network.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4." xml:id="_8FNbrfw">Power consumption</head><p xml:id="_9XS5hhP">Power consumption is the main performance metric in WMSNs as it is affected by the previously mentioned metrics. The nature of multimedia requires massive storage space and large bandwidth that consumes more and more power. Transmission power is required for WMSN nodes to manipulate visual flows, and energy-aware compression algorithms that reduce network life time. Therefore, adjusting processing complexity, transmission power reduction and minimizing data size will save the energy that represents the main performance criteria on this research.</p><p xml:id="_p994CAw">A number of related review papers have been proposed in literatures <ref type="bibr" coords="3,87.14,710.42,7.20,7.98" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,94.34,710.42,3.60,7.98" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,94.34,710.42,3.60,7.98" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,94.34,710.42,3.60,7.98" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,94.34,710.42,3.60,7.98" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,97.94,710.42,10.80,7.98" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.

Authors found that Set Partitioning In Hierarchical Tree (SPIHT) is the most suitable image compression algorithm in WSN due to its high compression ratio and simplicity of computations, since WSN needs low memory, speed processing, low power consumption, high compression ratios, less complex system and low computational load.</p><p xml:id="_uVgDdsa">Kumar et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,369.13,154.20,9.32,7.98" target="#b5">[6]</ref> discussed a new approach that enhances compression performance compared with JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) techniques and they used MSE and PSNR as the quality measures. Their approach was based on using singular value decomposition (SVD) and block truncation coding (BTC) with Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) in image compression technique. They depended on decision making parameter (x) which is based on observation of standard deviation (STD r) for deciding what compression technique can be used as follows:</p><p xml:id="_FuvaEQS">If r &lt; x use DCT Else if r &gt; x use SVD Else if 35 6 r 6 45 BTC Nasri et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,358.92,318.56,9.32,7.98" target="#b6">[7]</ref> introduced an efficient adaptive compression scheme that ensures a significant computational and energy reduction as well as communication with minimal degradation of the image quality. Their scheme was based on wavelet image transform and distributed image compression by sharing the processing tasks between clusters to extend the overall lifetime of the network.</p><p xml:id="_EEQfsPK">Ghorbel et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,369.58,395.26,9.32,7.98" target="#b7">[8]</ref> described robust use of DCT and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and their capabilities in WSN. They provided practical performance comparison between those techniques for various image resolutions and different transmission distances with 2 scenarios. The first scenario used two nodes only as transmitter and receiver, while, the second scenario using intermediate nodes between sender and receiver. The comparison was in terms of packet loss, reconstructed image quality, transmission time, execution time, and memory usage. They concluded that DWT is better than DCT as DWT had fewer packet losses (for Lena 32 * 32 it became clear from a distance 12 m and 7 m for Lena 64 * 64), higher image quality in terms of higher PSNR quality measure, minimal transmission time, faster execution time but large memory usage than DCT.</p><p xml:id="_tEtmzUA">Ghorbel et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,375.25,559.67,9.32,7.98" target="#b8">[9]</ref> extended their work on their previous research <ref type="bibr" coords="3,337.55,570.61,9.32,7.98" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and made compression performance analysis for DCT and DWT with additional important parameter which is energy consumption. They measured battery life time and concluded that DWT is better than DCT in terms of image quality and energy consumption.</p><p xml:id="_TU5qmJn">Ma et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,351.95,625.44,13.81,7.98" target="#b9">[10]</ref> surveyed multimedia compression techniques and multimedia transmission techniques and provided analysis for energy efficiency when applied to resource constrained platform. For image compression they discussed three important techniques JPEG (DCT), JPEG2000 (Embedded Block Coding with Optimized Truncation EBCOT), and SPIHT. They analyzed their work in terms of compression efficiency, memory requirement and computational load. They concluded that SPIHT is the best choice for energy-efficient compression algorithms due to its ability to provide higher compression ratio with low complexity. JPEG2000 (EBCOT) achieved higher compression ratio which mean better quality than SPHIT. However, complexity of EBCOT tier-1 and tier-2 operations caused intensive complex coding, higher computational load and more energy consumption for resource constrained systems.</p></div>

Lossy compression techniques achieve a high compression ratio that may exceed 50:1 while preserving visual image quality of reconstructed image. Otherwise, lossless achieves a less compression ratio compared with lossy that can reach up to 3 or 4 times of original image.

Where, it consumes more power due to encoder complexity (about 60% of the whole power <ref type="bibr" coords="6,104.66,388.80,12.83,7.98" target="#b15">[16]</ref>). Ma et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="6,162.48,388.80,13.81,7.98" target="#b9">[10]</ref> showed that the floating point implementation of JPEG had the highest computational load as execution time reached to 103.12 ms which consumed most of encoder energy. DCT divides the image into blocks that cause blocks artifacts and degradation in image compression performance. Moreover, there are many attempts to decrease computational complexity in DCT, Fakhari et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="6,253.65,454.56,13.81,7.98" target="#b19">[20]</ref> introduced new high throughput architecture for DCT processor using parallelism and pipelining on Xilinx virtex5 FPGA. In addition, Zheng and Liu <ref type="bibr" coords="6,149.90,487.44,13.81,7.98" target="#b20">[21]</ref> introduced a fast DCT algorithm based on JPEG <ref type="bibr" coords="6,114.81,498.38,13.00,7.98" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. They used binary DCT on JPEG encoder, all coefficients were binary and multiplications were replaced with shifting and addition operations that are easier and faster to be performed by software and hardware. Mammeri et al. in <ref type="bibr" coords="6,53.80,542.21,13.81,7.98" target="#b21">[22]</ref> addressed the problem of adapting JPEG to energy requirement of visual sensor network (VSN). They produced an energy aware adapted version of JPEG called squared JPEG (S-JPEG) that was based on RBS notation (reduced block size (P)) and used the upper-left squared portion of each DCT block. In addition, two performance metrics were considered, image quality at the sink and energy consumption during communication. From experimental result they found that image quality and energy consumption increase with P.</p><p xml:id="_MFeVCB7">There is a lot of literature based on discrete wavelet transform introducing an energy efficient technique for image compression in wireless sensor network. Ghorbel et al. in <ref type="bibr" coords="6,283.52,662.74,9.32,7.98" target="#b8">[9]</ref> proposed a performance analysis for image compression in WSN. They used DCT and DWT for their analysis and showed that DWT is better than DCT in terms of image quality and energy consumption. According to their figures, images qualities are better (for Lena 64 * 64) using DWT with PSNR reached to 33.55 db, 30.52 db using DWT, DCT respectively. On the other hand, they used rechargeable batteries Alkaline AA-NiMH 2850 mA h. They found that total batteries' lifetimes are 245.20 h, 281.34 h for DCT, DWT respectively. Nasri et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="6,333.92,179.72,13.81,7.98" target="#b17">[18]</ref> introduced an adaptive image compression scheme that minimizes computation and communication energies. This scheme is called skipped high pass sub-band ''SHPS'' that skips the computation of high pass coefficients as they have a very small value. Skipping is the least significant sub-band that reduces computational load and conserves energy. Additional technique beside SHPS <ref type="bibr" coords="6,430.92,245.48,13.00,7.98" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, is called elimination high pass filter EHPF <ref type="bibr" coords="6,380.30,256.42,13.81,7.98" target="#b18">[19]</ref> that applied only low pass filter in the vertical direction not high pass filter thus produce only LL, LH sub-bands that contain more important image information. Actually, this is the reason that helps EHPF to achieve some saving in computation energy with less degradation in image quality, however, SHPS achieved higher energy saving with higher degradation in image quality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_F4nN9PM">Those two proposed techniques create an adaptive compression technique called adaptive wavelet image compression and organization algorithm (AWICAO). Choosing the most effective technique depends on the trade-off between energy consumption and image quality.</head><p xml:id="_eDdV4c5">Implementing SPIHT <ref type="bibr" coords="6,409.38,387.95,13.81,7.98" target="#b22">[23]</ref> in power constrained WMSN is an excellent choice as it achieves a higher compression ratio, less computational complexity, lower power consumption and less complex implementation over EZW <ref type="bibr" coords="6,491.70,420.83,13.81,7.98" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and DCT. SPIHT achieves very compact output bit stream without adding an entropy encoder which allows efficiency in terms of computational complexity and decreases amount of data required to be transmitted (for 512 * 512 gray scale image), the encoder speed is 7 times faster using MSPIHT <ref type="bibr" coords="6,517.78,475.65,13.81,7.98" target="#b24">[25]</ref> and the decoder is 11 times faster. MSPHIT has saved 0.5625 MB of working memory. Ma et al. in <ref type="bibr" coords="6,496.41,497.53,13.81,7.98" target="#b25">[26]</ref> proposed an improved version of SPIHT that improved PSNR by 0.2-0.4 over different techniques without arithmetic coding. On the other hand, SPIHT requires more memory storage as it has three passes that cause increase in complexity. Many researches nowadays work to adapt SPIHT for WMSN by minimizing number of passes or eliminate them using wavelet lifting based scheme instead of convolutional scheme. SPIHT has great results on achieving high compression ratios with minimal consumed power. Sun et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="6,454.23,596.18,13.81,7.98" target="#b26">[27]</ref> proposed a real time implementation of SPIHT using DSP chip which reduced memory cost by 13-14 times as well as coding time till it reached to less than 40 ms.</p><p xml:id="_EcpRkpJ">Chong and Ang <ref type="bibr" coords="6,390.10,640.01,13.81,7.98" target="#b27">[28]</ref> used SPIHT with image stitching to make multi-view image compression for WMSN and to remove the overlap and spatial redundancy. Certain sensor nodes had higher processing power than other nodes because they were designed to perform image stitching process. Image sensors first captured images and sent images to microprocessor (nodes with higher processing power) to perform image stitching and remove overlap redundancy. Then stitched image  was compressed with modified SPIHT coding to reduce amount of transmitted bits. Their simulation result showed that the data to be transmitted can be reduced by 10-45% using the stitched images. Fu-Xiao et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="8,216.57,88.44,13.81,7.98" target="#b28">[29]</ref> used SPIHT to minimize image distortion in WMSN based on three stages. First stage wavelet transform on original image, second stage, SPIHT of wavelet coefficients and finally context based arithmetic coding for SPIHT stage result. Also, Zhao-Jinchuang et al. in <ref type="bibr" coords="8,87.53,143.20,13.81,7.98" target="#b29">[30]</ref> introduced an image coding algorithm for separated subtree based on no list SPIHT and segment transmission for bit stream that save energy and decrease number of bits to be transmitted. In addition, Wallace et al. in <ref type="bibr" coords="8,259.54,176.09,13.81,7.98" target="#b30">[31]</ref> proposed memory-efficient implementation of the wavelet-based image coding in WSN. They studied the effectiveness of an appropriate wavelet filter type that performs best results for SPIHT algorithm in WSN. Furthermore, implementing SPI-HT structure based on lifting cdf 9/7 filter with five levels of decomposition showed best results in terms of less computation and memory conservation.</p><p xml:id="_vuZ2bru">EBCOT <ref type="bibr" coords="8,99.78,263.79,13.81,7.98" target="#b31">[32]</ref> is the highest algorithm in the performance of compression quality. However, the operation of Tier-1 is responsible for arithmetic encoding and context formation for encoding code block. Thus, consumed most of encoder's power and consequently increase power consumption, computational complexity, memory required and processing time. Therefore, EBCOT not very beneficial for power constrained WMSN. It was reported in <ref type="bibr" coords="8,169.00,340.50,13.81,7.98" target="#b32">[33]</ref> that Tier-1 operation consumed more than 70% of encoding time followed by the DWT stage.</p><p xml:id="_v5ceRPj">Vector quantization has no transformation block, such as DCT or DWT, and entropy encoding block, which may reduce the computation complexity. This is attributed to simplicity of decoder operation which is responsible for only picking up the matching code word of vector index related to the code book at encoder side. Then reconstruct the image close to input image. Despite this, with the increase of vector dimensionality, complexity will increase and consequently an increase in power consumption and a decrease in processing speed occur. Therefore, VQ could be acceptable for power constrained WMSN with attempts focus on adapting VQ complexity with huge vector dimensionality. VQ technique was presented in <ref type="bibr" coords="8,253.36,493.91,13.81,7.98" target="#b33">[34]</ref> which used FRLVQ before applying standard VQ algorithm as preprocess. The proposed algorithm helped to design codebook in an image compression application. An improvement in resulted codebook PSNR was achieved by FRLVQ-fuzzy VQ which was approved by experimental results.</p><p xml:id="_MschPur">Fractals achieve higher compression ratios and good quality of reconstructed image over DCT, DWT and VQ.

On the other hand, fractals encoding process is computationally intensive due to complex task of finding all fractals and searching for the best match thus consumes more and more power which shortens life time of WMSN.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5." xml:id="_8hCBEtm">Research area and preliminary proposal</head><p xml:id="_SazdUSn">Due to the wide range of the WMSN applications based on energy constraint, compression algorithms may be considered as an important open research. In such area, image compression through low-complexity and resource-efficient transforms needs to be addressed to continue the network lifetime where power management is realized through sharing computational load among sensor nodes. Based on the taxonomy represented in Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="8,338.40,110.32,3.45,7.98" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, it can be concluded that the most important research area in this topic is as follows:</p><p xml:id="_2KAQvc4">The DCT, consumes the most power within a DCT-based compression scheme. It will be useful to decrease its computational complexity through establishing a novel algorithm that helps in: (1) Parallel and pipelined implementation of multidimensional DCT, which allows the main processing elements and arithmetic units to operate in parallel, leading to the reduction of both the computational complexity and the internal storage, as well as, the rise of throughput. ( <ref type="formula" coords="8,487.86,208.97,3.48,7.98">2</ref>) Working with fixed-point instead of the more complicated floating-point DCT. Comparing to fixed-point DCT, working with the floating-point DCT exhibits high energy consumption. (3) Converting the greedy operations such as multiplications into light operations. Indeed, DCT can be implemented using light operations such as shifts and additions only.</p><p xml:id="_r2dGMRv">The adoption of the EZW as a compression tool in WMSN can be valuable in terms of power consumption. This is due to the relatively simple complexity of its encoder and its progressive paradigm. An open research work should be the adaptation of the EZW algorithm to the power-constrained WMSN. That can be achieved by minimizing the number of passes to reduce the memory required to store the significant wavelet coefficients found at each pass.</p><p xml:id="_GXwkBZf">Implementing SPHIT on power-constrained devices is an excellent idea. Its advantages over JPEG and EZW in terms of high compression ratio, less computational complexity, and low power consumption as well as, less complex implementation make it possible to play an interesting role in image compression for power-limited applications. An open research work should be the adaptation of the SPIHT algorithm to the power-constrained WMSN. This can be done via substitution of lists by flags to reduce the memory usage, or using wavelet lifting scheme instead of the convolutional wavelet based. In addition, using one sorting list instead of three lists to store wavelet coefficients reduces memory usage.</p><p xml:id="_gjQ9Rpt">Compared with SPIHT, implementing EBCOT on power constrained devices achieves higher compression ratio but it is more computational complex and higher power consumption. Therefore, an open research work should be the adaptation of the EBCOT algorithm to the power-constrained WMSN. This can be achieved by merging the coding passes into one pass in order to improve the overall system performance and reducing system complexity, as well as, minimizing the memory requirements.</p><p xml:id="_uhjmEXm">Vector Quantization (VQ), can be an acceptable algorithm for WMSN as it achieves reasonable compression ratio and simplicity of the encoder compared with DCT or DWT. However, its complexity is increasing with vector dimensionality that consumes more power. Reducing memory required by VQ is an open research area to be acceptable for WMSN.</p><p xml:id="_ss4vZxW">On the other hand, Fractals achieve the highest compression ratio compared with other compression techniques, however, fractals shorten WMSN sensors life time due to intensive complexity of the encoder. An open research issue could be the adaptation of the fractals to the power-constrained WMSN. This can be performed by integrating fractals with transforma-tions such as DCT and DWT to decrease its computational complexity.</p><p xml:id="_H7T4v5m">There are some of recent papers which introduced some of certain techniques that are suitable for implementation on the hardware platform. Kaddachi et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="9,183.74,99.38,13.81,7.98" target="#b35">[36]</ref> presented architecture of FPGA suitable for WMSN, the core is 16-bit RISC microprocessor designed to operate at low frequency. They combined normal processor and image processing functions in one system. This architecture used 2D-DWT for color image compression using lifting scheme. For system implementation they used a CMOS camera, a Spartan-3 FPGA, a WSN transceiver and a battery. They concluded that DWT core consumed only 2.68 mW in active mode which is competitively low in comparison with other COTS microprocessors. Sun et al. in <ref type="bibr" coords="9,78.69,208.97,13.81,7.98" target="#b26">[27]</ref> proposed a real time implementation using DSP chip. They chose DSP-C6201 fixed point DSP that can perform up to 1600 MIPS. Their work reduced the memory cost by 13-14 times and coding time was greatly reduced as well. Fakhari et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="9,105.62,252.79,13.81,7.98" target="#b19">[20]</ref> introduced high throughput architecture for DCT processor using parallelism and pipelining on Xilinx virtex5 FPGA. Using parallelism in calculations for 64 different parts with a pipeline for reading, calculating and writing data contributes to speed up DCT operation dramatically. FPGA based image compression for low power WCSN was introduced by <ref type="bibr" coords="9,101.76,318.55,13.00,7.98" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. They used fast zonal DCT to reduce number of DCT coefficients needed to be computed, quantized and encoded. Hardware solution depended upon FPGA Virtex V had achieved shorter processing time. It is equal to 1.45 ms for k = 8 and 0.99 ms for k = 4, where k is size of the zonal DCT. Saving in processing time can be considered (around 99% of reduction). Also, DCT approach helped in reducing the energy consumption about 21.3% when k = 4 and 26.18% for k = 2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6." xml:id="_Hc7FqCY">Conclusion and future work</head><p xml:id="_j8MB97K">This survey has discussed various compression techniques for WMSN with comparison among them and factors that affect compression performance. Image quality, compression ratio, speed of compression and power consumption are the most important metrics discussed for compression performance. Performance metrics differ according to operating platform. Resource constrained platforms i.e. Wireless multimedia sensor networks have some limitations on memory, power consumption, processor capabilities and life time of sensor nodes. Therefore, SPIHT is the most powerful technique that can be used due to the following reasons: SPI-HT achieves very compact output bit stream and low bit rate with high compression ratio than that of its predecessor's EZW without adding an entropy encoder, which allows its efficiency in terms of computational complexity. Moreover, it uses a subset partitioning scheme in the sorting pass to reduce the number of magnitude comparisons, which also decrease the computational complexity of the algorithm. Finally, the progressive mode of SPIHT allows the interruption of coding/decoding process at any stage of the compression. Adapting SPIHT for WMSN to reduce memory required is an attractive future research area.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="4,194.17,723.85,215.34,7.55;4,116.16,505.42,368.95,207.33"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc xml:id="_7DdQjyN">Figure 1 Classification of image compression techniques.</figDesc><graphic coords="4,116.16,505.42,368.95,207.33" type="bitmap" /></figure>
