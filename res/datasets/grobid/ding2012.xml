<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="_fjE73pj"><p xml:id="_egJezH5">Interleukin (IL)-17 (also known as IL-17A), as the signature cytokine of the newly described T helper 17 (Th17) cell population, is the founding member of a new subclass of cytokines that have highly proinflammatory properties. Recently there is accumulating evidence that stipulates the involvement of IL-17 in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases via amplifying the inflammation induced by other cytokines in synergistic interactions. The present review provides a summary of the potential roles of IL-17 in the context derived from both animal models and clinical settings in cardiovascular diseases, and perspectives for IL-17-targeted cytokine therapy.</p></div>

T cells which can be induced to differentiate into various T helper (Th) subsets after activation are pivotal in regulating the immune and inflammation response in that they coordinate the functions of other immune cell types <ref type="bibr" coords="1,331.77,358.51,10.61,8.76" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Traditionally, Th cells are thought to develop into Th1 and Th2 cell subsets with distinct cytokine profiles and functions. Th1 cells are involved in autoimmune diseases and the eradication of intracellular pathogens (by producing interferon-c, IFN-c) while the Th2 cell lineage is important for participating the elimination of extracellular organisms (by producing interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-13) <ref type="bibr" coords="1,392.54,445.64,8.04,8.76" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,400.58,445.64,4.02,8.76" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,404.60,445.64,8.04,8.76" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.

IL-17 is implicated in numerous immune and inflammatory responses primarily as a proinflammatory regulator by inducing the expression of various inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, and growth factors <ref type="bibr" coords="1,514.60,545.25,10.77,8.76" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,529.29,545.25,9.97,8.76" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,539.26,545.25,4.99,8.76" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,539.26,545.25,4.99,8.76" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,306.14,557.72,11.84,8.76" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. There is emerging evidence that an increase in IL-17 level is closely associated with a range of inflammatory diseases including inflammatory bowel diseases, systemic lupus erythematosus, osteoporosis <ref type="bibr" coords="1,452.75,595.08,12.77,8.76" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,465.52,595.08,4.26,8.76" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,469.77,595.08,12.77,8.76" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Consistently, recent studies have demonstrated that IL-17 has a pivotal role in cardiovascular diseases and has been considered as a crucial regulator in cardiovascular diseases. In this review, we highlight our current knowledge on IL-17 and its role in cardiovascular diseases and hope that this information may aid the development of novel therapeutic strategies for cardiovascular diseases.</p></div>

Subsequent genomic sequencing resulted in the discovery of other five additional family members called IL-17B, IL-17C, IL-17D, IL-17E, and IL-17F and they all exerted proinflammatory activities <ref type="bibr" coords="2,167.24,171.70,15.82,8.76" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,189.35,171.70,11.84,8.76" target="#b23">24]</ref>. Among the IL-17 family members, IL-17 as a disulfide-linked homodimeric glycoprotein, is the most intensively investigated cytokine and has 155 amino acids with a molecular weight of 35 kDa <ref type="bibr" coords="2,85.60,221.53,15.81,8.76" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,106.13,221.53,11.84,8.76" target="#b24">25]</ref>. IL-17 gene is located on chromosome 6p12 and the cellular source of IL-17 is produced predominantly by a specific subset of Th cells, namely Th17 cells, but has more recently been expanded to include cd T cells, CD8 ? memory T cells, natural killer T cells, neutrophils eosinophils, macrophages and monocytes <ref type="bibr" coords="2,255.34,283.79,15.82,8.76" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,274.17,283.79,9.97,8.76" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,284.14,283.79,4.99,8.76" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,284.14,283.79,4.99,8.76" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,51.02,296.26,11.84,8.76" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. After binding to its receptors, the key biological function of IL-17 is it involvement in inducing and mediating immune and proinflammatory responses via other cytokines in synergistic interactions. Many studies demonstrated that IL-17 as a proinflammatory cytokine is involved in inflammatory bowel diseases, systemic lupus erythematosus, osteoporosis <ref type="bibr" coords="2,167.87,370.98,12.79,8.76" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,180.65,370.98,4.26,8.76" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,184.92,370.98,12.79,8.76" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_mbEuqGD">IL-17: signaling pathway</head><p xml:id="_xdmtUKR">Similar to the IL-17 cytokine family, IL-17 receptors form a unique family contained five members refer as to IL-17RA, IL-17RB, IL-17RC, IL-17RD, and IL-17RE <ref type="bibr" coords="2,227.51,458.11,15.31,8.76" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. The IL-17 receptors are expressed ubiquitously particularly in nonimmune origin, particularly epithelial and mesenchymal cells within diseased or inflamed tissues <ref type="bibr" coords="2,220.42,495.47,15.76,8.76" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,239.81,495.47,11.84,8.76" target="#b29">30]</ref>. Among these IL-17 receptors, IL-17 binding to both the IL-17RA and IL-17RC subunits mediates signalling pathway <ref type="bibr" coords="2,252.90,520.36,15.31,8.76" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. The biological activity of IL-17 is dependent on a formation of receptor complex composed of IL-17RA and IL-17RC <ref type="bibr" coords="2,270.02,545.30,15.26,8.76" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. IL-17 signaling through its receptors is distinct compared to typical adaptive Th cell cytokines. Rather than activating JAK-STAT pathways, IL-17 stimulates proinflammatory pathways more typical of innate, proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 or TLR agonists <ref type="bibr" coords="2,424.91,84.56,15.26,8.76" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. It was demonstrated that IL-17 signaling can induce various downstream pathways which include nuclear factor-jB (NF-jB), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways and the C/EBP transcription factors which can induce many production of various proinflammatory cytokines <ref type="bibr" coords="2,449.17,146.87,12.79,8.76" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,461.96,146.87,4.26,8.76" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,466.22,146.87,12.79,8.76" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Recent studies have shown that Act-1(the adaptor protein NF-jB activator 1) plays an important role in IL-17-dependent signaling <ref type="bibr" coords="2,306.14,184.17,12.79,8.76" target="#b35">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,318.92,184.17,4.26,8.76" target="#b36">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,323.19,184.17,12.79,8.76" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Additionally, the research by Schwander et al. showed that tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 was essential for IL-17-induced NF-jB activation and the expression of IL-6 or intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 <ref type="bibr" coords="2,350.75,234.00,15.30,8.76" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. Hence, the IL-17 signaling cascade is far from being completely understood.</p></div>

There is accumulating evidence that inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-6, TLR4, NF-jB) play a key role in the occurrence and development of cardiovascular diseases including atherosclerosis, cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury, heart failure, and myocarditis <ref type="bibr" coords="2,339.25,395.91,12.79,8.76" target="#b39">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,352.03,395.91,4.26,8.76" target="#b40">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,352.03,395.91,4.26,8.76" target="#b41">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,356.29,395.91,12.79,8.76" target="#b42">[43]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_EFBMPWa">IL-17 and Atherosclerosis</head><p xml:id="_DvXEngv">Atherosclerosis, defined as lipid-driven and chronic inflammation of the artery wall, involves a complicated interplay between many different cell types and cytokine networks. Both innate and adaptive immune responses have been demonstrated to regulate local and systemic inflammation during all stages of atherogenesis <ref type="bibr" coords="2,508.41,545.35,15.82,8.76" target="#b43">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,528.43,545.35,11.84,8.76" target="#b44">45]</ref>.

Recent research by Erbel and colleagues showed evidence for the proatherogenic role of IL-17 via proinflammatory changes at multiple levels such as cell adhesion, extravasation, cell activation, T cell (co) stimulation/proliferation, and antigen presentation <ref type="bibr" coords="3,258.23,109.51,15.31,8.76" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. In line with this result, several studies by various investigators have also demonstrated that IL-17 level is increased and IL-17 plays an essential proatherogenesis role in animal models and patients with coronary artery syndrome <ref type="bibr" coords="3,51.02,171.76,12.79,8.76" target="#b48">[49]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,63.81,171.76,4.26,8.76" target="#b49">[50]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,63.81,171.76,4.26,8.76" target="#b50">[51]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,63.81,171.76,4.26,8.76" target="#b51">[52]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,63.81,171.76,4.26,8.76" target="#b52">[53]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,63.81,171.76,4.26,8.76" target="#b53">[54]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,68.07,171.76,12.79,8.76" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. Interestingly, in contrast to these studies, Taleb et al. revealed that loss of suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS-3) in mouse T cells increased IL-17A production and induced an anti-inflammatory macrophage phenotype which can lead to a reduction in lesion development and vascular inflammation <ref type="bibr" coords="3,148.70,234.01,15.31,8.76" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. They concluded that IL-17 may have a protective role in atherogenesis despite it was unclear as to whether IL-10 or IL-17 was leading to the suppressor phenotype, as IL-10 can function as a very potent regulatory cytokine which is atheroprotective <ref type="bibr" coords="3,270.02,283.84,15.26,8.76" target="#b55">[56]</ref>.</p><p xml:id="_bGFRTAe">Additionally, these investigators also found that in vivo administration of IL-17 to LDLR -/-mice resulted in reduced endothelial VCAM-1 expression, reduced vascular T cell infiltration and atherosclerotic lesion development and then they concluded that endogenous expression of SOCS3 in T cells can interrupt a major regulatory pathway in atherosclerosis through inhibition of IL-17 production and that IL-17 may function as an atheroprotective cytokine. Taken together, these findings indicate that IL-17 plays dual role in the development of atherosclerosis and these potential mechanisms await more direct studies to address.</p></div>

The study also found that CD4 ?

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_cNyK54C">Conclusions and perspectives</head><p xml:id="_MNYP3nD">The effect of the revision of the Th1/Th2 paradigm to add Th17 cells cannot be overstated as it becomes a watershed in our understanding of the T cell-mediated pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. As the predominant product of Th17 cells, IL-17 owns an imperative proinflammatory role and clinical value in the occurence and development of cardiovascular diseases. Current cardiovascular researches suggest that the use of some drugs affecting the receptors and signal transduction pathway of IL-17 will become a hot area of clinical research and that the application of neutralizing antibodies or receptor antagonists of IL-17 to block its biological activity expression may provide a new therapeutic approach in cardiovascular disease research.</p><p xml:id="_4dRhU9H">With the mechanisms of IL-17 and its relevant cytokines to be further explored, IL-17 will have widespread application prospects in the prevention and clinical treatment of cardiovascular diseases.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_1" coords="3,306.14,121.79,238.10,457.22"><head></head><label></label><figDesc xml:id="_zQaKBqJ">-17 and heart failure</figDesc><table coords="3,306.14,146.87,238.10,432.13"><row><cell>Chronic heart failure,mainly caused by cardiac fibrosis and</cell></row><row><cell>ventricle remodeling, is a progressive syndrome and the</cell></row><row><cell>outcome of a variety of cardiovascular diseases.
