<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="_8YkTZHB"><p xml:id="_37gVPXe">Deep multi-view subspace clustering (DMVSC) has recently attracted increasing attention due to its promising performance. However, existing DMVSC methods still have two issues: (1) they mainly focus on using autoencoders to nonlinearly embed the data, while the embedding may be suboptimal for clustering because the clustering objective is rarely considered in autoencoders, and (2) existing methods typically have a quadratic or even cubic complexity, which makes it challenging to deal with large-scale data. To address these issues, in this paper we propose a novel deep multi-view subspace clustering method with anchor graph (DMCAG). To be specific, DMCAG firstly learns the embedded features for each view independently, which are used to obtain the subspace representations. To significantly reduce the complexity, we construct an anchor graph with small size for each view. Then, spectral clustering is performed on an integrated anchor graph to obtain pseudo-labels. To overcome the negative impact caused by suboptimal embedded features, we use pseudo-labels to refine the embedding process to make it more suitable for the clustering task. Pseudo-labels and embedded features are updated alternately. Furthermore, we design a strategy to keep the consistency of the labels based on contrastive learning to enhance the clustering performance. Empirical studies on real-world datasets show that our method achieves superior clustering performance over other state-of-the-art methods.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1" xml:id="_2PhFCMY">Introduction</head><p xml:id="_nYXgm6z">Subspace clustering has been studied extensively over the years, which assumes that the data points are drawn from lowdimensional subspaces, and could be expressed as a linear combination of other data points. Especially, sparse subspace clustering (SSC) <ref type="bibr" coords="1,123.48,662.27,113.56,9.79">[Elhamifar and Vidal, 2013]</ref> has shown the ability to find a sparse representation corresponding to the points from the same subspace. After obtaining the representation of the subspace, the spectral clustering is then applied to obtain the final clustering results. On the other hand, low-rank subspace segmentation was proposed in <ref type="bibr" coords="1,515.52,251.22,42.48,9.67;1,315.00,263.07,23.24,8.90" target="#b4">[Liu et al., 2012]</ref> to find a low-rank subspace representation. Despite some state-of-the-art performances have been achieved, most existing methods only focus on single-view clustering tasks.</p><p xml:id="_GUmB4rD">In many real-world applications, with the exponential growth of data, the description of data has gradually evolved from a single source to multiple sources. For example, a video consists of text, images, and audio. A piece of text can be translated into various languages, and scenes can also be described from different perspectives. These different views often contain complementary information to each other. Making full use of the complementary and consistent information among multiple views could potentially improve the clustering performance.</p><p xml:id="_prny9cn">Considering the diversity of information that comes with multi-view data, the research of multi-view subspace clustering (MVSC) has attracted increasing attention recently. MVSC aims to seek a unified subspace from learning the fusion representation of multi-view data, and then separates data in the corresponding subspace. In the literature, many MVSC methods have been proposed <ref type="bibr" coords="1,461.74,473.60,78.02,9.79" target="#b18">[Zhang et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,541.95,474.50,16.05,8.90;1,315.00,485.45,48.50,8.90" target="#b5">Luo et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,366.40,485.45,60.25,8.90">Li et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,429.55,485.45,74.39,8.90" target="#b14">Wang et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,506.84,485.45,51.16,8.90;1,315.00,496.41,22.69,8.90" target="#b19">Zheng et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,340.64,496.41,65.41,8.90" target="#b4">Liu et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,409.01,496.41,54.35,8.90" target="#b11">Si et al., 2022</ref>]. However, one major weakness of existing approaches is their high time and space complexities, which are often quadratic or cubic in the number of samples n. Recently, a number of anchor-based multiview subspace clustering methods <ref type="bibr" coords="1,463.95,539.35,94.05,9.79">[Chen and Cai, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,315.00,551.21,73.24,8.90" target="#b12">Sun et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,393.09,551.21,79.32,8.90" target="#b2">Kang et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,477.26,551.21,80.73,8.90" target="#b14">Wang et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,315.00,562.17,69.63,8.90" target="#b5">Liu et al., 2022]</ref> have been developed, which can achieve promising performance with a large reduction in storage and computational time. Generally, the anchor graphs are equally weighted and fused into the consensus graph, and then spectral clustering is performed to obtain the clustering result.</p><p xml:id="_UdNpwP2">On the other hand, inspired by deep neural networks (DNNs), many deep multi-view subspace clustering (DMVSC) methods have been proposed <ref type="bibr" coords="1,481.67,639.58,76.33,9.79" target="#b9">[Peng et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,315.00,651.44,76.12,8.90" target="#b14">Wang et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,394.54,651.44,117.76,8.90" target="#b2">Kheirandishfard et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,515.73,651.44,42.27,8.90;1,315.00,662.40,22.69,8.90" target="#b12">Sun et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,342.27,662.40,72.89,8.90" target="#b20">Zhu et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,419.72,662.40,62.24,8.90" target="#b1">Ji et al., 2017]</ref>. However, most DMVSC methods only consider the feature learning ability in networks, their performance is still limited because this learning process is typically independent of the clustering task.</p><p xml:id="_ne5BvHW">To address the above issues, this paper proposes deep multi-view subspace clustering with anchor graph (DM-CAG). DMCAG firstly utilizes deep autoencoders to learn low-dimensional embedded features by optimizing the reconstruction loss for each view independently. For each view, a set of points are chosen by performing k-means on the learned features to construct anchor graphs. Then, we utilize anchor graphs and embedded features as input to get the subspace representation respectively. Once the desired subspace representation is obtained, the clustering result can be calculated by applying the standard spectral clustering algorithm. Unlike the most existing DMVSC methods, the proposed method does not output the clustering result from spectral clustering directly. Instead, we obtain a unified target distribution from this clustering result primarily, which is more robust than that generated by k-means <ref type="bibr" coords="2,229.65,220.73,67.35,9.79" target="#b16">[Xie et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,54.00,232.58,67.63,8.90" target="#b18">Xu et al., 2022]</ref>, especially for clusters that do not form convex regions or that are not clearly separated. In a selfsupervised manner, the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the unified target distribution and each view's cluster assignments is optimized. We iteratively refine embedding with pseudo-labels derived from the spectral clustering, which in turn help to obtain complementary information and a more accurate target distribution. Besides, to ensure the consistency among different views and avoid affecting the quality of reconstruction, we adopt contrastive learning on the labels instead of latent features. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:</p><p xml:id="_nYKgEgt">• We propose a novel deep self-supervised model for MVSC. A unified target distribution is generated via spectral clustering which is more robust and can accurately guide the feature learning process. The target distribution and learned features are updated iteratively. In recent years, the application of deep learning technology in multi-view clustering has been a hot topic. Deep embedded clustering (DEC) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,126.46,606.71,70.99,9.79" target="#b16">[Xie et al., 2016]</ref> utilizes the autoencoder to extract the low-dimensional latent representation from raw features and then optimizes the student's t-distribution and target distribution of the feature representation to achieve clustering. In contrast, traditional multi-view clustering algorithms mostly use linear and shallow embedding to learn the latent structure of multi-view data. However, these methods cannot utilize the nonlinear property of data availably, which is crucial to reveal a complex clustering structure <ref type="bibr" coords="2,393.28,56.34,67.02,9.79" target="#b10">[Ren et al., 2022]</ref>. Deep embedded multiview clustering with collaborative training (DEMVC) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,542.51,67.30,15.49,8.90;2,315.00,79.16,55.48,8.90" target="#b17">[Xu et al., 2021a]</ref> is a novel framework for multi-view clustering, in which a shared scheme of the auxiliary distribution is used to improve the performance of the clustering. By assuming that clustering structures with high discriminability play a significant role in clustering, self-supervised discriminative feature learning for multi-view clustering (SDMVC) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,315.00,144.01,65.65,9.79" target="#b18">[Xu et al., 2022]</ref> leverages the global discriminative information contained in all views' embedded features. During the process, the global information will guide the feature learning process of each view. The autoencoder is usually utilized to capture the most important features present in the data. A suitable autoencoder can obtain more robust representations. Deep embedding clustering based on contractive autoencoder (DECCA) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,358.96,220.72,82.34,9.79" target="#b0">[Diallo et al., 2021]</ref> simultaneously disentangles the problem of learned representation by preserving important information from the initial data while pushing the original samples and their augmentations together. With the introduction of the contractive autoencoders, the learned features are better than normal autoencoders. The available information provided by latent graph is often ignored, deep embedded multi-view clustering via jointly learning latent representations and graphs (DMVCJ) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,446.18,308.40,80.54,9.79">[Huang et al., 2022]</ref> utilizes the graphs from latent features to promote the performance of deep MVC models. By learning the latent graphs and feature representations jointly, the available information implied in latent graph can improve the clustering performance. The self-supervised manner is widely used in deep clustering, which is valuable to migrate it to other clustering algorithms.</p></div>

Low-rank tensor constrained multi-view subspace clustering (LMSC) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,416.07,475.00,77.93,9.79">[Zhang et al., 2017]</ref> learns the latent representation based on multi-view features, and generates a common subspace representation rather than that of individual view. Flexible multi-view representation learning for subspace clustering (FMR) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,412.70,518.83,64.04,9.79">[Li et al., 2019]</ref> avoids using partial information for data reconstruction and makes the latent representation well adapted to subspace clustering.</p><p xml:id="_m8dZ4uk">Most of existing MVSC methods are challenging to apply in large-scale data sets. Fortunately, inspired by the idea of anchor graph which can help reduce both storage and computational time, a lot of anchor-based MVSC methods have been proposed. Large-scale multi-view subspace clustering (LMVSC) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,359.36,606.71,73.85,9.79" target="#b2">[Kang et al., 2020</ref>] can be solved in linear time, which selects a small number of instances to construct anchor graphs for each view, and then integrates all anchor graphs from each views. It thus can perform spectral clustering on a small graph. Efficient one-pass multi-view subspace clustering with consensus anchor (CGMSC) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,516.48,661.50,41.52,9.67;2,315.00,673.36,23.24,8.90" target="#b5">[Liu et al., 2022]</ref> unifies fused graph construction and anchor learning into a unified and flexible framework so that they seamlessly contribute mutually and boost performance. Fast multi-view anchor correspondence clustering (FMVACC) <ref type="bibr" coords="3,243.80,56.34,53.20,9.67;3,54.00,68.20,23.24,8.90" target="#b14">[Wang et al., 2022]</ref> finds that the selected anchor sets in multi-view data are not aligned, which may lead to inaccurate graph fusion and degrade the clustering performance, so an anchor alignment module is proposed to solve the anchor-unaligned problem (AUP).</p><p xml:id="_GNVG7S6">With the development of deep neural networks, a number of deep multi-view subspace clustering methods have been proposed. Deep subspace clustering with 1 -norm (DSC-L1) <ref type="bibr" coords="3,71.96,154.97,77.39,9.79" target="#b9">[Peng et al., 2020]</ref> learns nonlinear mapping functions for data to map the original features into another space, and then the affinity matrix is calculated in the new space. Deep multi-view subspace clustering with unified and discriminative learning (DMSC-UDL) <ref type="bibr" coords="3,166.59,198.81,76.26,9.79" target="#b14">[Wang et al., 2020]</ref> integrates local and global structure learning simultaneously, which can make full use of all the information of the original multi-view data. Different from the above-mentioned deep multi-view clustering methods, we combine representation learning and spectral clustering into a unified optimization framework, the clustering results can be sufficiently exploited to guide the representation learning for each view.</p><p xml:id="_DAxrjRU">3 Method Problem Statement.</p><p xml:id="_wUA3mbt">Given multi-view data</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="3,54.00,311.98,243.00,21.72">X = {X v ∈ R d v ×n } V</formula><p xml:id="_tZsfD9A">v=1 with V views, d v is the dimension of the v-th view, and n is the instance number.

The final clustering assignment is obtained by performing spectral clustering on the learned subspace. Basically, it can be mathematically denoted as: min</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="3,117.29,437.22,179.72,43.51">X v V v=1 ||X v − X v S v || 2 F + γ||S v || 2 F s.t.

The constraints on S v ensure that S v is non-negative and j S i j = 1. When the adjacency graphs are obtained, spectral clustering can be performed on S v to get the clustering result. Existing MVSC methods aim at learning concrete subspace effectively and mining global information of all views to improve the clustering assignment quality, but still meet some challenges:</p><p xml:id="_hyVYQsR">(1) Most MVSC methods require high time complexity (at least O(n 2 k)) to calculate the clustering result on raw features, which requires more storage and time and is also difficult to deal with large-scale datasets. Additionally, some DMVSC methods such as <ref type="bibr" coords="3,125.79,628.63,64.38,9.79" target="#b1">[Ji et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,194.00,629.52,63.82,8.90" target="#b3">Li et al., 2021]</ref> focus on learning subspace by nonlinearly embedding the data. Since the connection between the learned subspace and clustering is weak, the learned features may not be optimal for the clustering task.</p><p xml:id="_tBjeySU">(2) From existing self-supervised MVC methods, we can observe that most of them heavily depend on the quality of latent representations to supervise the learning process. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,542.51,56.34,15.49,8.90;3,315.00,68.20,51.26,8.90" target="#b18">[Xu et al., 2022]</ref> fuses the embedded features of all views and utilizes k-means <ref type="bibr" coords="3,383.29,78.26,75.97,9.79" target="#b6">[MacQueen, 1967]</ref> to obtain the global target distribution. However, k-means does not perform well on some data structure such as non-convex structure compared with spectral clustering <ref type="bibr" coords="3,409.01,111.14,64.78,9.79" target="#b7">[Ng et al., 2001]</ref> which is more robust to different distributions. Hence, their obtained pseudo-labels may not reflect clear clustering structure to guide the latent feature learning process.</p><p xml:id="_rJsQHPY">(3) Some views of an instance might have wrong clustering assignment, leading to the clustering inconsistency. Some deep-learning based MVC methods achieve the consistency by directly learning common information on latent features <ref type="bibr" coords="3,315.00,198.81,78.30,9.79">[Cheng et al., 2021]</ref>, which may reduce the complementarity of each view's information due to the conflict between learning exact latent representations and achieving consistency.</p><p xml:id="_ahf7YfC">To address the above-mentioned issues, we propose a novel DMCAG framework as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="3,471.72,243.54,3.74,8.90">1</ref>. We use the anchor method to construct the graph matrix on latent features of each view which requires less time and storage. After that, we obtain global pseudo-labels by performing spectral clustering on the integrated anchor graph. Since spectral clustering is more robust to the data distribution, our self-supervised process can learn higher discriminative information from each view. Then, we adopt contrastive learning on pseudo-labels of latent features to maintain the view-private information and achieve the clustering consistency among all views.</p></div>
