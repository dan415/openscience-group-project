Because the blood isn't moving around the body as efficiently, it tends to get congested in various areas of the body and increases strain on the heart. Benazepril is a drug for CHF used in both dogs and humans to reduce congestion and improve the functioning of the cardiovascular system. Although benazepril is effective, there's evidence that suggests the dosing could be improved if the therapeutic was further studied.</p><p xml:id="_SRJwhZC">In this experiment, we tested benazepril at several safe dosages in well-cared for and healthy dogs to collect data on the relationship between dose size, dosing frequency, and effect on the cardiovascular system. Using this data, we built computer models of benazepril to simulate many clinical trials. By studying these simulations, we were able to make several predictions about the optimal dosing schedule of benazepril in dogs. We've also built a web-app version of the computer model for veterinary researchers to use, modify, and study. This work also provides a platform and roadmap for optimizing benazepril dosages in human CHF.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_3AmM5j4">INTRODUCTION</head><p xml:id="_WeSajpU">Although the exact pathophysiology of the heart diseases underlying congestive heart failure <ref type="bibr" coords="2,496.25,765.01,29.99,9.93">(CHF)</ref> differ between man and his best friend, overactivation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a key role in the pathogenesis and development of CHF in both humans and dogs. To reduce RAAS activation, there is a substantial history of using ACEis, such as benazepril, to treat CHF in both species <ref type="bibr" coords="3,107.82,76.19,9.60,9.93" target="#b0">(1)</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,117.43,76.19,4.80,9.93" target="#b1">(2)</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,122.23,76.19,9.60,9.93" target="#b2">(3)</ref>. This makes the use of benazepril to treat CHF in canines and humans an excellent case study for applying the One Health Initiative paradigm. This paradigm recognizes that accumulating data on the effect of therapeutics on CHF in canines has the potential to benefit therapeutic management of CHF in humans and vice versa <ref type="bibr" coords="3,276.28,137.72,12.41,9.93" target="#b3">(4)</ref>.</p><p xml:id="_5Dfybxq">The RAAS is a neurohormonal compensatory system which primarily manages blood volume and pressure by modulating electrolyte transport and vascular tone. The contemporary model of RAAS activation has two main components. The classical RAAS pathway refers to the peptide cascade from angiotensinogen to angiotensin I (AngI), and then from AngI to angiotensin II (AngII). These enzymatic reactions are catalyzed by renin and ACE, respectively, and ultimately lead to increased aldosterone (ALD) production (see Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="3,176.41,272.03,4.60,9.93" target="#fig_1">1</ref>; (4)). Short-term physiologic consequences of classical RAAS activation include vasoconstriction, renal sodium and water retention, and increased blood pressure. Long-term physiological consequences include fluid overload, increased cardiac afterload, and myocardial and vascular fibrosis <ref type="bibr" coords="3,124.95,333.56,9.60,9.93" target="#b4">(5)</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,134.55,333.56,4.80,9.93" target="#b5">(6)</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,134.55,333.56,4.80,9.93" target="#b6">(7)</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,134.55,333.56,4.80,9.93" target="#b7">(8)</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,139.35,333.56,9.60,9.93" target="#b8">(9)</ref>. Essentially, chronic long-term classical RAAS activation both contributes to, and is stimulated by, the development of CHF <ref type="bibr" coords="3,246.65,353.82,18.70,9.93" target="#b9">(10,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,265.35,353.82,14.03,9.93" target="#b10">11)</ref>, while classical RAAS pathway downregulation has been associated with improved long-term prognosis in CHF <ref type="bibr" coords="3,335.07,374.83,15.08,9.93" target="#b8">(9,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,350.15,374.83,10.05,9.93" target="#b11">(12)</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,360.20,374.83,5.03,9.93" target="#b12">(13)</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,360.20,374.83,5.03,9.93" target="#b13">(14)</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,365.23,374.83,15.08,9.93" target="#b14">(15)</ref>. The alternative RAAS pathway acts as a counterregulatory mechanism against classical pathway activation. Activation of the alternative RAAS pathway is characterized by catalysis of AngII to angiotensin (1-7) (i.e. Ang(1-7)) by the enzyme ACE2. In turn, Ang(1-7) activates Mas receptors leading to vasodilatation, diuresis, and natriuresis <ref type="bibr" coords="3,523.75,436.35,18.14,9.93" target="#b15">(16)</ref>.</p><p xml:id="_zwpJBCu">Via this physiological effect, chronic alternative RAAS activation in CHF has been associated with reduced risk of heart failure in patients with reduced and preserved ejection fraction. An ideal therapeutic drug candidate for CHF would therefore modulate both pathways at once, downregulating the activity of the classical RAAS while preserving or upregulating the alternative RAAS pathway <ref type="bibr" coords="3,447.82,518.14,18.14,9.93" target="#b12">(13)</ref>. However, little is known about the effect of benazepril on the alternative RAAS in either humans or dogs.</p><p xml:id="_ya5h38r">about:blank 4/28 Benazepril inhibits ACE, therefore activating the alternative RAAS pathway (in green). Activation of the alternative RAAS pathway is characterized by catalysis of Ang II to Ang1-7 by the enzyme ACE2. In turn, Ang1-7 activates Mas receptors leading to vasodilatation, diuresis, and natriuresis. These effects are protective against CHF.</p><p xml:id="_eMFHxsw">Our goal is to use mathematical modeling to determine a dosage which both reduces classical RAAS pathway activation and stimulates alternative RAAS pathway activation. This hypothetical dosage would maximize CHF-protective effects of benazepril.</p><p xml:id="_Qk48e6w">Benazepril hydrochloride is a non-sulfhydryl ACEi commonly used for the management of CHF in both humans and dogs. Like other ACEi, benazepril is a prodrug that is rapidly converted through hydrolysis to its active benazeprilat by esterases, mainly in the liver <ref type="bibr" coords="4,320.98,484.38,18.14,9.93" target="#b16">(17)</ref>. Although frequently prescribed, the recommended dosage range of benazepril is quite broad and there is no clear consensus on the ideal dose to be used in patients with CHF. In humans, benazepril is typically prescribed for hypertension at an initial dose of 2.5-10 mg per day and up titrated to 20 or 40 mg per day, administered either once or twice daily (q24h or q12h) which is roughly equivalent to 0.5 mg/kg q12h for a 60 kg adult <ref type="bibr" coords="4,480.29,566.16,18.14,9.93" target="#b17">(18)</ref>. In dogs, the labeled dose of benazepril in the EU is 0.25-1.0 mg/kg PO q24h, whereas ACVIM veterinary consensus statements recommend a dose of 0.5 mg/kg PO q12h <ref type="bibr" coords="4,363.27,607.43,18.14,9.93" target="#b18">(19)</ref>. Pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) studies comparing various doses of benazepril in healthy dogs have not provided consistent recommendations to date. The study that was used for registration of benazepril in the EU showed that a single PO dose of benazepril effectively suppressed ACE activity for up to 24 hours, and that ACE inhibition in plasma was independent of dosage ≥ 0.25 mg/kg (2). However, subsequent reanalysis of these data using mathematical modeling suggested that q12h dosing (as opposed to q24h dosing) would achieve greater inhibition of ACE with the same q24h total dose <ref type="bibr" coords="4,511.57,730.49,18.14,9.93" target="#b19">(20)</ref>.</p><p xml:id="_bMcgjM6">Furthermore, a different study of single dose enalapril and benazepril at a dosage of 0.5 mg/kg indicated a much shorter duration of effect, with ACE suppression lasting &lt; 12 hours <ref type="bibr" coords="4,408.09,771.76,18.14,9.93" target="#b20">(21)</ref>, and a recent retrospective study in dogs with valvular heart disease suggested improved outcomes with q12h dosage <ref type="bibr" coords="5,42.88,55.18,18.14,9.93" target="#b21">(22)</ref>.</p><p xml:id="_JYrq6xJ">There are several reasons why developing consistent recommendations for dosing of ACEi has proven challenging in veterinary medicine. Historically, ACE activity was used as a surrogate for RAAS activity.</p><p xml:id="_jyD7Dwh">Recently, however, ACE activity has been shown to be an inefficient measure of RAAS activation.</p><p xml:id="_PnvjJxp">Numerous studies in humans and dogs have shown a lack of correlation between circulating ACE activity and Ang II concentrations <ref type="bibr" coords="5,207.06,169.23,13.66,9.93" target="#b3">(4,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,220.72,169.23,13.66,9.93" target="#b22">23)</ref>. A second challenge in developing scheduling recommendations is the significant chronobiological modulation of the RAAS. Previous experimental models of RAAS activation failed to consider the chronobiology of the RAAS, while contemporary research has shown that biomarkers of the renin pathway are subject to circadian variations in dogs <ref type="bibr" coords="5,429.43,230.76,14.16,9.93" target="#b3">(4,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,443.59,230.76,14.16,9.93" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,457.75,230.76,14.16,9.93" target="#b23">24)</ref>. Finally, existing PKPD studies on the effect of various ACEi have not consistently sampled biomarkers of alternative RAAS activation in addition to biomarkers of classical RAAS activation.</p><p xml:id="_EZ9cH4M">Overall, although the effects of ACEi, such as benazepril, on ACE activity have been fairly well characterized, and the benefit of ACE inhibition in CHF has been definitively established in several clinical trials in both humans and dogs (0.25 to 1.0 mg/kg q12h-q24h), little is known about the effect of benazepril on the alternative RAAS pathway in either species. Understanding the dose-dependent effects of benazepril on biomarkers of both the classical and alternative RAAS pathways in dogs would allow exploration of benazepril dosages that produce a downregulation of the classical RAAS while preserving, or upregulating, the alternative RAAS. This would translate into an optimization of the clinical benefit. Accumulating data that inform such a nuanced approach to dose optimization in dogs would provide valuable translational information for similar dose optimization of ACEi in humans. To model and predict the dose-dependent effects of benazepril on the classical and alternative arm of the RAAS, we aimed to build a nonlinear mixed-effects (NLME) model of benazepril PKPD. NLME modeling of benazepril PKPD had already previously been shown to be an efficient method for describing the effect of benazepril on the classical RAAS in canines and is a well-accepted framework for building PKPD models <ref type="bibr" coords="5,81.47,570.67,17.65,9.93" target="#b10">(11)</ref>.</p><p xml:id="_ZPuZ9nj">To produce data for this modeling and simulation effort, nine healthy beagles were intensively sampled while administered benazepril at various dosages and frequencies. After producing the data, our objective was to use a quantitative-systems pharmacology (QSP) model to characterize the PKPD relationship of benazepril(at) on biomarkers of the RAAS which are relevant to CHF pathophysiology and associated with morbidity/mortality {angiotensins I, II, III, IV, (1-7)}. QSP modeling is a subgroup of PKPD models which seeks to describe the behavior of a pharmaceutical in terms of the biology of its mechanism of action. After developing and calibrating the model, we further developed a software implementation of the benazeprilat-RAAS QSP model, which is capable of rapidly simulating the effect of benazepril HCL at various doses in a larger population of virtual dogs. By developing an easy-to-use simulation interface for our model, the objective of this work was to make a first prediction of the optimal dose/time of benazepril administration in dogs in support of future investigations in patients with CHF.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_qDGqKpu">PK Model Building</head><p xml:id="_NRweJBe">The PK portion of the base model was a conventional Zero-, first-, mixed-, and sequential absorption structures were tested to model drug absorption from the depot compartment (i.e., intestinal lumen). A model largely equivalent to sequential absorption, but made to be continuous, was found to outperform other competitive models. This model substructure uses a series of 1-order absorptions but can be seen as a continuous analog to a sequential 0-/1-order absorption.</p><p xml:id="_p7TKrJY">In this model, the first depot compartment for benazepril after oral administration was called 1abs. Firstorder absorption either occurred immediately at rate ka to the compartment of freely circulating benazeprilat (fr), or absorption was delayed by an absorption rate ka through an intercompartment that was pre-circulatory (pr). As is typical, quantity of benazeprilat passed between compartments is called I , for inhibitor, where indexes m and n represent origin and destination compartments, respectively.</p><p xml:id="_kKWn9Vj">F represents the total bioavailability (Eq. 4). Doses are administered in benazepril hcl, but are measured as the metabolite -benazeprilat. To reduce complexity in modeling, but preserve absorption and benazepril to benazeprilat conversion variance, all bioavailable benazepril is treated as benazeprilat in the model. F , or total bioavailability, is estimated in the model purely to preserve this variance and to reduce numerical instability in estimation. However, without IV data, the final estimated F does not have a firm pharmacological interpretation.</p><p xml:id="_4en3XG9">In summary, the final mammillary model without ACE binding kinetics (Eq. 5) was a 2-compartment PK model with nonspecific protein binding represented by a 3 compartment (I ), and a continuous analog to sequential 0-/1-order absorption from some depot compartment.</p><p xml:id="_kvwW78j">Rate of exchange between compartments were governed by rates k where f and g (f ≠ g) were each one of either free circulation (fr), tissue (ts), or non-specifically bound in circulation (ns).

To modulate classical RAAS overactivation in CHF, there is a substantial history of using ACEi such as benazepril in both species <ref type="bibr" coords="16,319.16,587.17,13.69,9.93" target="#b1">(2,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="16,332.86,587.17,9.13,9.93" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="16,341.99,587.17,13.69,9.93">44)</ref> well-characterized both in the veterinary and human literature, little is known about the effect of ACEi on the alternative arm of the RAAS. Therefore, any further dose optimization of ACEi is dependent on studying the effect of this therapeutic drug on the alternative pathway. Characterizing this effect in dogs essentially furthers our understanding of how to optimize therapeutic management of canine CHF while providing valuable insight into the molecular effects of ACEi for translation to human CHF (45).</p><p xml:id="_jDc2qWe">Additionally, in humans and in dogs, the recommended dosage range for benazepril is quite broad and there is no clear consensus on the ideal dose in patients with CHF. PKPD studies comparing various doses of benazepril in healthy dogs have not provided consistent recommendations. In King et al.</p><p xml:id="_xs7G6zV">(1995) a single PO dose of benazepril effectively suppressed ACE activity for up to 24 hours, and that ACE inhibition in plasma was independent of dosage ≥ 0.25 mg/kg <ref type="bibr" coords="17,369.96,230.76,18.14,9.93" target="#b16">(17)</ref>. Subsequent reanalysis of these data using PK modeling suggested that q12h dosing would achieve greater inhibition of ACE with the same total q24h dose <ref type="bibr" coords="17,151.32,272.03,18.14,9.93" target="#b19">(20)</ref>. Later, Hamlin &amp; Nakayama (1998) found a single dose of benazepril at 0.5 mg/kg suppressed ACE for &lt; 12 hours <ref type="bibr" coords="17,232.48,292.29,18.14,9.93" target="#b20">(21)</ref>. Lastly, a recent retrospective study in dogs with valvular heart disease suggested improved outcomes with q12h dosage <ref type="bibr" coords="17,354.72,312.55,18.14,9.93" target="#b21">(22)</ref>.</p><p xml:id="_q6YFmYm">In this study, we have attempted to address knowledge gaps in optimal benazepril dosing by describing the dose-dependent effects of benazepril on biomarkers of both the classical and alternative RAAS pathways in dogs. The solution we implemented to address these gaps in knowledge was to build a modeling and simulation platform of the effect of benazepril on both arms of the RAAS. This simulation engine allows for exploration of benazepril dosages that produce both a substantial downregulation of the classical RAAS while preserving or upregulating the alternative RAAS. This allows for side-by-side comparison of several dosage schemes using virtual clinical trials and ultimately optimization of clinical benefits.</p><p xml:id="_VS6zGHY">Several metrics were used in assessing model performance. Population-level goodness-of-fit diagnostic plots like observations vs. predictions and NPDEs indicated that structural misspecification was very low.</p><p xml:id="_dFvFhEF">Focusing on individual predictions, we see a dynamic model capable of fitting complex individual variations without being overly fit to noise and spurious trends in the data. Importantly, for such a large set of parameters, our precision of parameter estimates was very high. Some parameters had to be fixed to exploratory values to achieve that precision, but this is an expected outcome when using enzyme kinematic models. Of note, although the precision of these parameters was high, they should not be overly interpreted without experimental verification.</p><p xml:id="_YKZZQAy">Using our simulation engine, we chose to compare several reasonable dosing schedules, including 0.25 mg/kg PO q24h and 0.5 mg/kg PO q12h -covering the range of dosing schedules most commonly used in the EU and US. Comparisons between dosing schedules were made based on area under the effect curve of the biomarker response (AUEC) relative to placebo. Chronobiology played a modest role in the scheduling of benazepril in this study. While using the simulation engine to explore various dosages, evening dosing appears to produce the lowest variance in the classical RAAS, morning dosing appears to produce the lowest variance in AngIII and AngIV PD.</p><p xml:id="_Q382vYV">Morning and evening administration both produce the same relative AUC improvement over placebo across the biomarker panel.</p><p xml:id="_6JbEQGH">Of the schedules compared, the most robust downregulation of classical RAAS biomarkers and upregulation of alternative RAAS biomarkers was observed with the 0.5 mg/kg PO q12h dose of benazepril. However, this should be put in context because the improvement of 0.5 mg/kg q12h over 0.25 mg/kg q12h is 26.14%, 9.93%, 14.73%, 9.35%, and 10.1% for AngI, AngII, Ang(1-7), AngIII, and AngIV, respectively. Those respective changes in classical and alternative RAAS biomarker concentrations will need to be linked to clinical outcomes in order to inform a clinical dosage selection.</p><p xml:id="_bfWqE8F">An interesting finding from our simulations is that there is generally high agreement between q24h and q12h dosing of benazepril, as long as the total dosage per day is kept constant. For example, 0.5 mg/kg q24h and 0.25 mg/kg q12h produce similar pharmacodynamic effects on the RAAS, although q12h dosing led to fewer fluctuations of the angiotensins in plasma compared to q24h dosing.</p><p xml:id="_j8WU2eh">To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first description of a simulation engine designed to optimize dosages of therapeutic drugs in veterinary medicine. Although experimental validation is necessary for bedside application, the model structure readily lends itself to such validation. Many parameters are directly measurable because they have meaningful pharmacological interpretations. For example, the Michaelis-Menten kinetic parameters which govern ACE inhibition could potentially be measured independently -possibly in vitro. Additionally, the kinetics of each individual molecule can be measured separately in IV-PK timecourse studies in vivo. Furthermore, by using a combination of in vitro studies for defining enzyme kinematic parameters, in vivo studies of individual metabolite kinetics, literature values for baseline parameters, and allometric scaling of mammillary compartment parameters, this model can be easily adapted into a bedside tool in both canines and humans.</p><p xml:id="_nK8DhRZ">There are several practical limitations in this study worth recognizing to guide future model refinement.</p><p xml:id="_KQjWycT">First, our results were derived from an experimental model of RAAS activation in response to benazepril, rather than a clinical trial in canine CHF patients. Also, the sample size of the study was quite limited compared to a mature clinical trial design. Lastly, the therapeutic window was not considered when making comparisons between dosing schedules. Specifically, there are high doses of benazepril the user can specify in our simulation engine (max. 2mg/kg q6h) that have not been tested experimentally;</p><p xml:id="_cBWmMt5">although safety up to 1 mg/kg q24h has been established in previous studies <ref type="bibr" coords="18,419.67,716.23,18.14,9.93" target="#b21">(22)</ref>. This extensive QSP model of the RAAS in response to benazepril and the development of that model into a tool for bedside optimization of benazepril for CHF and similar diseases is highly novel. By developing an easy-to-use simulation interface for our model, we are now able to make a first prediction of the optimal dose/time of benazepril administration in dogs in support of future investigations in patients with CHF. Beyond the research presented in this manuscript with our tool, simulation tools can continuously expand the impact of scientific research by being used to test new hypotheses surrounding dose optimization and being improved when new data becomes available to refine parameter estimates.</p><p xml:id="_aapNRNX">The data we measured in an experimental model of RAAS activation has yet to be linked directly to clinical outcomes in CHF, so there is room to expand the model into disease outcomes with a link function. This will be necessary for ultimate application in dosage selection. The most important extension is to experimentally validate a relevant selection of simulations; this option is currently being explored. This model-based approach is now supporting the design of an upcoming prospective multicenter clinical trial in canine patients with CHF to confirm findings from our simulator and refine our model-based predictions with actual clinical information. This clinical trial will help to confirm if the difference observed in PKPD between different dosages is translated into clinical benefits in dogs with naturally occurring CHF.</p></div>

Dogs were acclimatized to the facility for &gt;1 month prior to the experiment. Dogs were pair-housed in adjoining pens (approximately 2m per dog or 4m per pair) on elevated rubbercoated grated flooring. Housing conditions were standardized with ambient temperatures of 18°C, a 12hour light cycle (07:00 to 19:00), and access to water ad libitum. During intensive sampling days only (D1, D18, and D35), dogs were separated into single housing units and water consumption was quantified every 8 hours for the 24-hour period. After sample collection on baseline sampling days (D-5, D12, and D29), dogs were offered a low-sodium diet (Hill's Prescription Diet h/d, 17 mg sodium per 100 kcal) at 23:00 q24h for five days to attain a steady activation of RAAS <ref type="bibr" coords="20,173.36,76.19,14.17,9.93" target="#b3">(4,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="20,187.53,76.19,14.17,9.93" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="20,201.69,76.19,14.17,9.93" target="#b23">24)</ref>.

Volume of low-sodium diet was calculated so that the dogs received the same caloric intake throughout the study. Venous blood samples were collected from an external jugular or cephalic vein with a 1 inch, 20-gauge or 22-gauge needle attached to a 6 mL syringe. Dogs were kept and maintained in the same position (seated with neck extended) during blood collection. On intensive sampling days, approximately 4 mL of whole blood was collected at each time point with 2 mL transferred to an additive-free collection tube and 2 mL transferred to a lithium heparin tube containing 11.2 μL of dichlorvos prepared as a 6 mg/mL solution in acetonitrile. On baseline days, approximately 6 mL of whole blood was collected with 2 mL placed in an additive-free tube for RAAS analysis, 2 mL placed in an EDTA tube for complete blood count, and 2 mL placed in an additive-free tube for serum chemistry panel. On sparse sampling days, 2 mL of blood was collected and placed in an additive-free tube. All samples intended for pharmacokinetic or RAAS analysis were centrifuged for 15 minutes, after which plasma or serum was transferred into cryovials that were then stored at −80°C for later analysis. Samples for complete blood counts or serum chemistry panels were analyzed by the Iowa State Clinical Pathology Laboratory.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_uTZ7H9f">Model Building</head><p xml:id="_YP4VFus">The systems pharmacology model was built in two consecutive phases. First, a largely empirical PKPD model with minimum parameterization was built to capture basic biological variations in the data. In practice, this entailed fitting a basic 1-, 2-, or 3-compartment model to the pharmacokinetics of benazeprilat, and then linking the PK to the RAAS biomarkers concentrations via various indirect and direct response models. Whenever possible we opted for direct over indirect effects models, and fewer compartments, to reduce the number of total estimated parameters during model fit.</p><p xml:id="_64HhTCd">Then, in an iterative fashion, model components were replaced with more mechanistic structures. To do this, we modeled the cascade of peptides which define the alternative and classical RAAS pathways. We also tested whether we could expand the mathematical model to include important biological systems such as the clearance of angiotensins via the liver vs. kidneys, non-specific plasma binding, first-pass metabolism, and site-specific metabolism. Some components and parameters of the model structure were arbitrarily fixed to literature or exploratory values to preserve fidelity to relevant biological systems.</p><p xml:id="_gV6W3xg">For example, our model equations were rewritten so that the production of AngII was always one-to-one proportional with catalysis of AngI via the angiotensin converting enzyme. The final model was refined through various arithmetic simplifications and parameter search optimizations to improve precision of parameter estimates as much as possible without comprising fit to experimental data. The significance of bodyweight, sex, sodium intake, and benazepril dose on parameters estimates was further evaluated using the automated Pearson's correlation test and ANOVA method as implemented in Monolix 2020 R1.</p></div>

Quality of fit was evaluated using standard goodness-of-fit diagnostics (e.g., observed vs. predictions, scatter plot of residuals), as well as numerical summaries of fit, such as the corrected Bayesian information criteria (BICc). Precision of parameter estimates were determined using residual standard error (RSE%).</p><p xml:id="_RQ89RsW">Normalized prediction distribution errors (NPDEs) are recommended for evaluating model misspecification when study design is heterogenous with respect to dosing groups <ref type="bibr" coords="23,445.98,665.21,18.14,9.93" target="#b32">(34)</ref>. In this study, we had several different study groups under varying dosing schedules; therefore, NPDEs were chosen to determine quality of fit over more conventional visual predictive checks. In practice, NPDEs evaluate the percentage of the distribution of predictions at each mean prediction under the observation, thus forming a heterogenous uniform distribution. Therefore, an inverse cumulative distribution function is applied to each value to obtain a probability density function vs. population prediction.</p><p xml:id="_ZKwAyZw">Programming Tools and Simulations All programming relevant to the simulation application was written in R v4.0.2 (28). Models were translated from Mlxtran (Monolix Suite 2020R1) to the domain specific language, and R package, Odin v1.2.1 <ref type="bibr" coords="24,75.97,76.19,19.61,9.93" target="#b33">(35)</ref> to simulate clinical trials.

Odin was used because of its superior ability to solve large systems of ODEs over other R packages.</p><p xml:id="_CFpKrVC">Finally, the application for simulating clinical trials was built in Shiny v1.6.0.

All dogs received all treatments using a partial crossover (ABC/BCA/CAB) design. Dogs were sampled in the same order at each time point and exact time of sampling was recorded. Blood sample collection was divided into baseline sampling days (D-5, D12, and D29), sparse sampling days (days 0, 17, and 34), and intensive sampling days (D1, D18, and D35). Baseline and sparse sampling occurred at 07:00.On intensive sampling days (D1, D18, and D35), blood was collected starting at 07:00 (0 hour, immediately before oral benazepril dosing) and repeated at + 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 12.5, 13, 14, 16, 20, and 24 hours post-dosing. Benazepril (NELIO 5 mg chewable tablets, Ceva Sante Animale) was administered on intensive sampling days following the 0-hour blood sampling (all dose groups) and the 12-hour sampling (q12hr dose groups only). The benazepril dose was calculated to the nearest 1.25 mg increment.</figDesc></figure>
