CAVD is characterized by fibrous thickening and calcification of the aortic valve cusps, leading to narrowing of the valve orifice. Originally, this disease was described as passive and degenerative but it is now well established that CAVD is a cell-mediated, actively regulated inflammatory disease <ref type="bibr" coords="2,443.90,350.81,9.20,9.93" target="#b5">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,453.10,350.81,4.60,9.93" target="#b6">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,453.10,350.81,4.60,9.93" target="#b7">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,457.69,350.81,9.20,9.93" target="#b8">[7]</ref>. Currently, there are no approved medical therapies to prevent or reverse calcification of the aortic valve. The only treatment options are open heart surgery with aortic valve replacement (SAVR) or transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVR) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,172.31,412.34,11.49,9.93" target="#b9">[8]</ref>. It is of upmost importance to better understand the mechanisms underlying this disease in order to identify feasible pharmaceutical and non-surgical/interventional therapies.</p><p xml:id="_jhJZyQe">In healthy humans, the tricuspid aortic valve (AV) consists of three cusps, which are covered by valvular endothelial cells (VECs) on the aortic and ventricular sides. The interstitium of the valve is composed of three main layers with ubiquitously distributed valvular interstitial cells (VICs). During the pathogenesis of AVS, different stimuli, including shear stress and mechanical strain, trigger VEC dysfunction, resulting in lipoprotein/phospholipid infiltration and oxidation <ref type="bibr" coords="2,292.24,567.67,9.46,9.93" target="#b11">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,301.70,567.67,4.73,9.93" target="#b12">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,306.44,567.67,14.19,9.93" target="#b13">[11]</ref>. VECs lose their protective and regulative properties and can transdifferentiate into myofibroblast-like VICs, a process referred to as endothelial to mesenchymal transition (EndMT) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,207.63,608.18,14.95,9.93" target="#b14">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,222.58,608.18,4.98,9.93" target="#b15">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,227.56,608.18,14.95,9.93" target="#b16">[14]</ref>. Disruption of the endothelial layer also enables infiltration of immune cells into the AV, promoting the release of pro-inflammatory stimuli, and driving osteogenic differentiation of VICs <ref type="bibr" coords="2,151.11,649.45,12.27,9.93" target="#b11">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,166.44,649.45,13.79,9.93" target="#b17">15]</ref>. This osteogenic differentiation of VICs, from a fibroblastic to an osteogenic phenotype, induces the formation of calcium nodules, thus leading to AV calcification <ref type="bibr" coords="2,457.43,669.71,12.27,9.93" target="#b11">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,472.76,669.71,13.79,9.93" target="#b18">16]</ref>. It is pivotal to further investigate these molecular and cellular mechanisms of AV cell populations involved in CAVD.</p><p xml:id="_acunZ49">However, isolation and cultivation of VECs and VICs is technically and methodologically highly demanding. Here, we offer a novel AV cell isolation method that can be applied in all cell culture laboratories. A variety of organisms can be used for such cell culture experiments, including human and pigs <ref type="bibr" coords="3,509.68,34.92,14.94,9.93" target="#b19">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,524.62,34.92,4.98,9.93" target="#b20">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,524.62,34.92,4.98,9.93" target="#b21">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,529.60,34.92,14.94,9.93" target="#b22">[20]</ref>.</p><p xml:id="_sdN7KVg">In general, human material is advantageous over animal material when studying potential therapeutic targets involved in disease pathogenesis in humans. While tissue from patients with CAVD can be used for genetic screening, cells from non-stenotic and healthy patients are the most useful and authentic platform to study disease progressions (e.g., induction of osteoblastic differentiation and EndMT).</p><p xml:id="_cG7hSfB">Calcified cusps from diseased human AVs can be obtained from patients undergoing AV replacement surgery due to severe AVS. Control tissues are more difficult to obtain, since non-calcified aortic valves are less often explanted (e.g. in the setting of aortic root or ascending aorta dilatation/aneurysm, when aortic regurgitation occurs as a consequence). It is therefore of importance to investigate whether other organisms, which are genetically comparable to humans, can be used as tissue donors for cell isolation.</p><p xml:id="_vH5utTc">Undoubtedly, acquiring high-quality control samples from healthy or non-stenotic AVs is challenging. In addition to the most obvious problems, individual patients naturally display a high variability in age, sex, congenital, pre-existing, and concomitant diseases <ref type="bibr" coords="3,292.83,281.03,17.17,9.93" target="#b23">[21]</ref>. Thus, the degrees of calcification patterns differ immensely between patients and with respect to sex. Due to these difficulties, the most frequently used AVs tissues for cell isolation are obtained from large animals which resemble humans genetically, such as pigs <ref type="bibr" coords="3,80.86,342.56,14.94,9.93" target="#b24">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,95.81,342.56,4.98,9.93" target="#b25">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,100.79,342.56,14.94,9.93" target="#b26">[24]</ref>. An advantage of porcine tissue over human material is that healthy tissue can be obtained more easily from abattoirs or animal research facilities. The hearts and AVs are healthy without being affected by other diseases, and the cells can therefore be isolated and expanded more efficiently in vitro. The size and the substantial amount of tissue in porcine AVs makes it easier to study the cusps' mechanical properties or to isolate cells. Moreover, the whole heart can be used for research, whereas in humans usually only one valve is explanted <ref type="bibr" coords="3,269.55,445.36,17.16,9.93" target="#b27">[25]</ref>.</p><p xml:id="_Qg49vAa">Although porcine valves appear to be anatomically and genetically similar to humans, there could be differences in specific molecular pathways. To date, no direct comparison of human and porcine VECs and VICs has been undertaken <ref type="bibr" coords="3,197.89,518.14,17.16,9.93" target="#b28">[26]</ref>. In this study, we undertook a major comparison of pig and human AV cells in order to identify a more easily available alternative to human material for cell culture experiments. Cells were isolated in a cell population-specific manner and characterized further. Cell culture experiments, such as in vitro EndMT and calcification induction, were performed in human and porcine cells to analyze and compare their response to these external stimuli.</p></div>

Our quantification revealed a significant upregulation in endothelial marker expression in hVECs, such as von Willebrand factor (vWF) and platelet endothelial adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) compared to hVICs. Myofibroblastic markers, alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and vimentin (VIM), were downregulated (Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,158.66,387.58,9.80,9.93" target="#fig_4">1b</ref>). Immunofluorescence staining demonstrated an increase of intracellularly localized vWF and an expression of the endothelial marker, PECAM-1, whereas no expression of α-SMA and VIM was observed, further providing evidence that isolated cells were hVEC (Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,477.80,428.85,9.50,9.93" target="#fig_4">1c</ref>). Analysis of hVEC migration capacity via a scratch wound closure revealed only 15% scratch width after 8 hours (Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,83.30,470.12,9.80,9.93" target="#fig_4">1d</ref>), suggesting these cells maintain endothelial migration capacities, a further confirmation of pure hVEC population. To further assess if hVECs were able to undergo EndMT in vitro, cells were incubated with 30 ng/μl TNFα for 7 days. hVECs displayed increased expression of mesenchymal markers, such as α-SMA and VIM, and decreased expression of endothelial markers, namely vWF and PECAM-1 (Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,135.36,551.91,9.50,9.93" target="#fig_4">1e</ref>), demonstrating hVEC's mesenchymal transdifferentiation capacity. These data suggest that elevated mesenchymal marker expression represents an effective EndMT induction.  MACS-sorted hVICs were characterized by RT-qPCR to quantify interstitial marker gene expression (Figure <ref type="figure" coords="7,83.30,304.29,9.50,9.93" target="#fig_5">2a</ref>). Whereas α-SMA and VIM expression were significantly upregulated, vWF as well as PECAM-1 showed decreased expression values compared to hVECs (Figure <ref type="figure" coords="7,423.89,324.55,9.80,9.93" target="#fig_4">1b</ref>). In immunofluorescence staining of hVICs a positive staining for intracellularly distributed α-SMA and VIM was observed and expression of vWF and PECAM-1 was not detected (Figure <ref type="figure" coords="7,430.01,365.82,9.80,9.93" target="#fig_5">2b</ref>). To analyze the migration properties of hVICs, a scratch wound was performed, and the closure observed for 8 hours.</p><p xml:id="_rYqGUHb">The remaining scratch area was 87% after 8 hours (Figure <ref type="figure" coords="7,333.23,407.09,9.50,9.93" target="#fig_5">2c</ref>). In vitro calcification, by incubating hVICs with OM or PCM for 7 days revealed an overexpression of alkaline phosphatase (ALPL), a hallmark of calcification, in OM but not in PCM (Figure <ref type="figure" coords="7,254.79,448.36,9.80,9.93" target="#fig_5">2d</ref>). In addition, other calcification-related genes, for instance, osteocalcin (BGLAP) and runt-related factor 2 (RUNX2), were upregulated in both conditions.</p><p xml:id="_7p3R9pW">Alizarin red staining of calcified cells provided a further layer of confirmation that the isolated cells were VICs with osteoblastic differentiation capacity (figure <ref type="figure" coords="7,303.62,509.89,9.50,9.93" target="#fig_5">2e</ref>). These data also confirmed that in vitro calcification of isolated hVICs could be induced successfully. To assess whether porcine cells can be used alternatively for cell culture experiments instead of difficultto-obtain human cells, porcine VECs (pVECs) and porcine VICs (pVICs) were characterized. Cells were isolated using the same protocol as for human cells (Figure <ref type="figure" coords="8,336.91,76.19,9.50,9.93" target="#fig_6">3a</ref>). Analysis of characteristic marker gene expression in isolated pVECs revealed elevated vWF and PECAM-1 levels and a reduction of α-SMA compared to pVICs. VIM was also upregulated in pVECs (Figure <ref type="figure" coords="8,362.64,116.71,9.80,9.93" target="#fig_6">3b</ref>). In immunofluorescence staining, positive staining for vWF was observed but no α-SMA signal was detectable in pVECs (Figure <ref type="figure" coords="8,504.97,137.72,9.50,9.93" target="#fig_6">3c</ref>). To assess the migration behavior of hVECs, a scratch wound assay was performed which revealed a scratch closure to 70% after 8h (Figure <ref type="figure" coords="8,238.27,178.23,9.80,9.93" target="#fig_6">3d</ref>). This data provided evidence that pVECs displayed an endothelial specific phenotype. However, in vitro EndMT induction using TNFα demonstrated a decrease of EndMT markers (Figure <ref type="figure" coords="8,176.79,219.50,9.50,9.93" target="#fig_6">3e</ref>), indicating that cells had not undergone efficient transdifferentiation. To characterize isolated pVICs, using the same protocol as for human cells (Figure <ref type="figure" coords="8,450.83,412.34,9.50,9.93" target="#fig_8">4a</ref>), characteristic interstitial cell markers were analyzed, showing an upregulation of α-SMA in pVICs compared to pVECs (Figure <ref type="figure" coords="8,83.30,452.86,9.80,9.93" target="#fig_6">3b</ref>). Noteworthily, endothelial markers, vWF and PECAM-1 as well as VIM were decreased.</p><p xml:id="_3E6JJmV">Immunofluorescence staining displayed a positive signal for α-SMA and VIM, while vWF and PECAM-1 were undetectable (Figure <ref type="figure" coords="8,176.43,494.13,9.80,9.93" target="#fig_8">4b</ref>). Scratch-wound based functional assays revealed a scratch closure after 8 hours of 87% (Figure <ref type="figure" coords="8,160.49,514.39,9.50,9.93" target="#fig_11">5c</ref>). These data suggest a VIC specific phenotype of the isolated cells. To assess whether calcification can be induced in pVICs in vitro, cells were incubated with OM or PCM for 7 days, showing a significant upregulation of calcification-related genes, namely, ALPL, BMP2, BGLAP and osteopontin (SPP1) in OM and PCM (Figure <ref type="figure" coords="8,284.84,575.92,9.80,9.93" target="#fig_11">5d</ref>). Additionally, alizarin red staining revealed enhanced calcific nodule staining in OM treated and more pronounced staining in PCM treated cells, due to deposition of calcium phosphate (Ca (PO ) ) into the cellular matrix (Figure <ref type="figure" coords="8,427.91,617.19,9.50,9.93" target="#fig_11">5e</ref>). This data provided evidence that pVICs can be utilized for in vitro calcification experiments.

Human aortic valve tissue is difficult to obtain, and the acquisition of non-stenotic control tissues is often especially challenging. In principle, living aortic valve cells can be gained from donor hearts that are unsuitable for transplantation, as long as the aortic valve is not affected by underlying disease <ref type="bibr" coords="9,432.93,461.12,17.16,9.93" target="#b32">[29]</ref>. This is the most suitable source of control tissue, but since there are only few transplant units and a limited number of donors who would be appropriate candidates, this material is difficult to obtain <ref type="bibr" coords="9,424.34,502.39,18.40,9.93" target="#b33">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="9,445.81,502.39,13.79,9.93" target="#b34">31]</ref>. It is also possible to use valves that were explanted because of aortic dissection, since this is presumed to not affect the aortic valve <ref type="bibr" coords="9,101.68,543.65,17.17,9.93" target="#b35">[32]</ref>. However, these operations are typically performed as emergency operations, with ensuing problems concerning both informed consent and the isolation procedure. The most common source of non-calcified human aortic valve tissue are patients undergoing SAVR due to aortic regurgitation in the context of aortic root or ascending aortic aneurysm.</p><p xml:id="_KaT4rjW">Standardizing the method of aortic valve cell isolation is crucial to ensure optimal data exchange between investigators. In a first attempt to standardize cell isolation from human and porcine aortic valve tissues, we propose a method based on previous publications with some refinements <ref type="bibr" coords="9,460.06,677.97,18.39,9.93" target="#b19">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="9,481.52,677.97,15.33,9.93" target="#b21">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="9,499.91,677.97,15.33,9.93" target="#b25">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="9,518.31,677.97,15.33,9.93" target="#b36">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="9,42.88,698.23,13.79,9.93" target="#b37">34]</ref>. We removed VECs from AVS cusps via scraping cells from valve tissue by the careful use of a scalpel prior to collecting and affinity-based isolation. This increased the number of VECs gained from the isolation process, when compared to removal with a cotton swab. Moreover, we added a magneticactivated cell sorting (MACS, Miltenyi Biotech) step with the specific endothelial marker endoglin (CD105) in order to ensure a pure VEC isolation <ref type="bibr" coords="9,280.56,780.01,17.17,9.93" target="#b24">[22]</ref>. This endothelial cell separation has previously been described for human vascular endothelial cells. Based on our study, plating VICs on a collagencoated 75 cm culture flask is more appropriate for cell culture-based experiments <ref type="bibr" coords="10,445.04,55.18,18.39,9.93" target="#b19">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="10,466.50,55.18,13.79,9.93" target="#b22">20]</ref>. Due to the thorough sorting and lesser number of VECs in general, VEC yields are significantly lower than VIC yields and thus, porcine or human cells can be plated on one fibronectin-coated 6-well to enable cell-cell interaction <ref type="bibr" coords="10,96.79,116.71,17.17,9.93" target="#b19">[17]</ref>.</p><p xml:id="_zXEVMPY">The second aim of this manuscript was to compare human and porcine VECs and VICs with each other to assess whether easier-to-obtain porcine aortic valve tissues and their cells can be used for primary in vitro investigations to study human AVS pathologies. We found commensurabilities but also disparities between human and porcine aortic valve cells. Under physiological conditions hVECs and pVECs resemble endothelial cells covering the vasculature displaying a typical cuboid, endothelial cell shape with cell-junctions and expression of specific endothelial markers such as PECAM-1 and vWF <ref type="bibr" coords="10,501.69,251.02,17.17,9.93" target="#b38">[35]</ref>. To test whether the differentiation of VECs to mesenchymal cells by TNFα treatment can be performed successfully, gene expression analysis of EndMT markers, such as α-SMA and VIM were performed after 7 days of TNFα treatment <ref type="bibr" coords="10,196.05,312.55,17.16,9.93">[36]</ref>. In hVECs incubated with TNFα, the expression of mesenchymal cell markers such as α-SMA and VIM was increased, whereas vWF and PECAM-1 were decreased. In pVECs the endothelial makers were also downregulated but surprisingly, this also applies for α-SMA and VIM. During this transition, activated VECs progressively lose their endothelial properties, including cell junctions, and their specific endothelial markers, display increased cellular invasion and acquire a mesenchymal phenotype with improved migratory capabilities <ref type="bibr" coords="10,342.14,415.34,17.88,9.93" target="#b38">[35]</ref>. hVICs and pVICs displayed the typical spindle-shaped VIC morphology with a swirling pattern that start to grow over each other at confluency <ref type="bibr" coords="10,98.63,456.61,17.17,9.93" target="#b25">[23]</ref>.

In healthy human aortic valves, most VICs are considered to be quiescent with a fibroblast-like phenotype, which can be distinguished from VECs by positive expression of VIM and the absence of endothelial markers vWF and PECAM-1 <ref type="bibr" coords="10,373.08,518.14,14.95,9.93" target="#b42">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="10,388.03,518.14,4.98,9.93" target="#b43">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="10,393.01,518.14,14.95,9.93" target="#b44">[41]</ref>.

However, there is currently no reproducible experimental standardization, which would be crucial to ensure optimal comparisons between laboratories and to connect all findings. This manuscript aims to initiate the first step towards standardization of human and porcine aortic valve cell isolation. In vitro experiments with the aortic valve, cells are immensely important to improve our understanding of involved pathomechanisms during the development of CAVD and will undoubtedly lead to the identification of druggable targets.</p><p xml:id="_maQVuqC">Additionally, no direct and detailed comparison between human and porcine aortic valve tissue has been reported.</p><p xml:id="_RMJKEEz">However, our study has some limitations, namely, the patient samples were all collected at the University of Bonn, Germany, thus, the patient-derived data presented is limited to the Caucasian race. Therefore, no information on race-dependent differences and heterogeneities were derivable in isolated cells from AV tissues of AVS patients who underwent SAVR. Although the characteristic gene expression levels of VIC and VEC markers are similar in patient-derived valvular cells there are some differences in cells of porcine origin, as confirmed by RT-qPCR. Due to the technological limitations of valve cell isolations, it is still very challenging to completely confirm that valvular cell populations are absolutely pure and without any other contamination in the isolates. In cardiovascular research, a wide range of studies has reported dynamic alterations in the expression of genes during different cardiovascular conditions, leading to an interest in single-cell resolution investigations <ref type="bibr" coords="11,262.93,353.82,14.21,9.93" target="#b47">[44]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="11,277.13,353.82,4.74,9.93" target="#b48">[45]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="11,281.87,353.82,14.21,9.93" target="#b49">[46]</ref>.

We demonstrated for the first time in detail, that 1) patient-derived AV cells, namely, VICs and VECs, isolated from AV tissue explants from AVS patients can be isolated as a pure population.
